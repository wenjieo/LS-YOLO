#LS-YOLO: A Novel Model for Detecting Multi-Scale Landslides with Remote Sensing Images

A novel multi-scale landslide detection model based on MSFE and Improved Decoupled Head is proposed.

We created a new multi-scale landslide dataset called MSLD, which has 9,623 images and corresponding label files.
